# sc-unpacker

I cannot apply the transformation, since after applying it the picture crawls out of the edges, I do not know how to fix this and I do not think that it is possible to do it in Python, so I postpone the project for a while until I rewrite it to  another programming language, maybe it will be C#

# Why this project is archieved?
Since September, 22, 2020, i have been working on [XCoder](https://github.com/Vorono4ka/XCoder), so there is no reason to continue supporting this project
